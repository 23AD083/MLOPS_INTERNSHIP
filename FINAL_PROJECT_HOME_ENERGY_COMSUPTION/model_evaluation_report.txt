AI Smart Energy Consumption Prediction - Project Summary
=====================================================

**Project Overview:**
This project develops an AI-powered system to predict hourly energy consumption in a smart city using environmental and infrastructure data. The goal is to optimize energy distribution, reduce wastage, and provide actionable insights for smart grid management.

**End-to-End Workflow:**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collected real-world energy usage data (home_energy.csv) and, optionally, zone-wise data (Tetuan City dataset).
   - Data includes timestamp, voltage, current, sub-meter readings, and environmental features.
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
   - Handled missing values, sorted by time, and extracted time-based features (hour, day of week, month).
   - For zone-wise analysis, only numeric columns are used for modeling.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Used XGBoost regression to predict energy consumption.
   - Split data into training and test sets (80/20 split).
   - Trained separate models for each selected zone (if zone data is available).
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Calculated MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² (accuracy) for each model.
   - Visualized actual vs. predicted consumption and residuals.
5. **Interactive Dashboard:**
   - Built a Streamlit app for real-time prediction, visualization, and user input.
   - Users can upload their own data, select features/zones, and get instant predictions and model metrics.

**Zone-Based Analysis:**
- The dashboard allows you to select and analyze different city zones (e.g., Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3).
- For each zone, the model is trained and evaluated independently.
- You can compare R² (accuracy) and error metrics across zones to identify which areas have more predictable or variable energy usage.
- High R² (e.g., 0.9990) indicates the model explains nearly all the variance in the data, showing excellent predictive power for the selected features and zone.

**Current Results (home_energy.csv):**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0140
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0006
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.0240
- R² Score: 0.9990

**Interpretation:**
- The model achieves extremely high accuracy (R² ≈ 1.0), meaning it can reliably predict energy consumption given the selected features.
- Low MAE and RMSE indicate very small average prediction errors.
- For zone-wise data, use the dashboard to view and compare metrics for each zone interactively.

**Conclusion:**
This end-to-end solution enables smart, data-driven energy management for cities and households. The interactive dashboard empowers users to explore, predict, and optimize energy usage in real time, supporting sustainability and operational efficiency.
